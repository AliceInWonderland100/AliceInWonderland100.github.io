title: Finally, my blog is on Git!
---

I spent a couple times trying to set up my blog based on https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now on GitHub. Not long ago, I realized my long-ago-registered username does not match my blog username. Phew, finally got it right by bothering to change my original username!

_config.yml file in the root of your repository (shown below).

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/config.png)

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
