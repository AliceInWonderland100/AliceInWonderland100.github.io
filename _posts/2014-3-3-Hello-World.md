title: Finally, my blog is on Git!
---

I spent a couple times trying to set up my blog based on https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now on GitHub. Not long ago, I realized my long-ago-registered username does not match my blog username. Phew, finally got it right by bothering to change my original username!

The happy face of Alice in Wonderland should be more than this(shown below).

Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](www.google.com) on GitHub.
