There is no vanity of Manhattan, dignity of Boston, or delicacy of London. Instead, it constantly and seamlessly transforms between French pride and American boldness, all of which will be swallowed into underground by the snows. There is, indeed, an underground city, a city full of Sortie sighs but no Sortie at all, and it is like Brave New World version of escape the room.

Bagels here are huge and unique enough to launch a war against the New York City bagels. There are equivalently fabulous latte and Chinese restaurants that runs all night. Besides food, scenery is also attractive. The city streets spread out from around the mountain. Foliage is still at infancy at this end of October but colorful leaved trees decorate the mountain and the city. Each street end ends with a fantasy for foliage. The entire city is an art museum. The top of the mountain, at the center of the city, sees almost every high rise and low rise. The high-rises are as plentiful as in Chicago, especially in late nights.

In an ordinary weekend with absence of Pride Parade, street stores are not open until 12pm. Human activities will not occur and be seen until 1pm. The stores race to close before the sun sets. City enters night life before it went dark.

When the majority of time of the majority of people does not belong to group activities, how much solitude does this city carry? Tons of solitude nurtures self to the fullest. Be one self, is the No.1 way to go in this city.

This is a French district within 6 hour drive. Having not been to Paris yet, I dreamt to be here to seek French tastes. French tastes intertwine American pragmatisms here. Like fake Fendi, it is not so real but still works. Paris aside, this is a complete self, with its own personality, free-spirited, calm and mysterious. Next stop for real French tastes, it only has to be Paris.
