I'm an intensive shared economy user, as commented by others. I have memberships of Hubway, Zipcar and I took UberPOOL intensively. Besides all the economic benefits, I consider it a social opportunity. Indeed, it left me with some lastingly fun stories. Tonight, I had two.

My last uber ride was heading home from a Chinese restaurant. When I entered the car, it is already filled with laughters and excitement. As the driver continues driving, 
the girl next to me in the back seat, holding the back of the driver's seat, says to the person in the front seat, so you are not from Europe, 

no, not from Europe. Oh it is a she. she said.

You are not from Asia either. No I'm not.

Wait,, how many languages do you speak?

I speak 4 languages.

What?! 4?! The driver turned his face to her for a sec with astonishing look.

She continues to ask, how come 4 languages while you are not from Europe, which four?

I cannot tell you that then you will know directly where I am from. She chuckles.

The girl next to me is even more excited. I'm also turned on and cannot wait to join the conversation.

Persian! I said immidiately this comes up to my mind.

She said yes. They were obviously exhausted from guessing but surprised that I got it right for just once.

I speak Persian, Asaibaijiang, Turkey and English. Everybody is more surprised.

She said, my parents are from asaibaijiang, that's why I speak it.

They aske me how I got it. I said I am recently very interested in Persian history and actually am reading one book called 1453 on it.

Then we continues to guess where she is from.
