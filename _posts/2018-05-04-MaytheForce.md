夏至未至，明天才是夏至。

波士顿一年四季无尽的风，在一个漫长的冬天结束夏天到来时，依然风作不止，这个季节合着夏天的暖，裹挟着以前的夏天记忆袭来。那许多陪伴过自己的人儿啊，我们曾经的欢声笑语就如此殆尽了么，我能想起那天的温度和空气的味道都是如此熟悉，包括对方的穿着和气息，我要是再努力一点都会想起对方的样貌和眼神，却又有股劲想让自己别去想。就像荡秋千，荡起来，那些画面浮现上来，仿佛一触即是，马上又荡下去，记忆挥去。有些歌，不想懂，却仿佛越来越懂。

《后来》

Hello Yin,

How are you doing and how are the girls? I haven’t reached out for long, my bad. Hope everything is very well with both of your work and family. 

I am now with State Street Bank in Boston, doing more and more quant work over the years. Btw, Joy also joined State Street and I felt lucky to have her in touch again.

If possible, I have a favor to ask regarding my green card application. As my current employer is sponsoring my green card application, I wonder if you could please help prove my work experience back at Capital One. If so, I will pass along the experience letter drafted for your review and signature. Deeply appreciate it.

Hope to chat more if you have the time as well. Looking forward to hearing from you 

All the best,
Elise
